This is a Simon Says game 
The team members consist of Micheal Carson, Rodrigo Arroyo, Petit Izere, and Dhananjaya Khatiwada. This team worked together to  code a Simon says game using Javascript, HTML, CSS
it is a fun and simple game which challenges the user to memorize a pattern displayed. By completing a pattern correctly, the player moves up a level and a new challenge emerges. If the player selects a wrong click that means the game over!

This game can be useful to people that are bored, and looking for entertainment. This project can be helpful to those that are looking for examples of how to code a simon says game. Anyone can clone this repository and add on if they like, or do their own version as well. Some of the issues that we experienced is some members had blockers because they had interviews, and of course determining how would do what. But in all the team enjoyed working together to get the repo up and running, coding the program itself, and putting in place a powerpoint to present.
